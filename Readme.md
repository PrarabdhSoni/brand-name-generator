## About The Project

This project is a basic web application built to practice Node.js and Express.js fundamentals. It demonstrates a simple client-server interaction where two strings are submitted from a frontend form, concatenated (added together) on the backend using Express.js, and then displayed on a new page.

This was a hands-on exercise to understand:

Setting up an Express.js server.

Handling GET and POST requests.

Accessing form data from the client-side.

Rendering dynamic content on the server.
